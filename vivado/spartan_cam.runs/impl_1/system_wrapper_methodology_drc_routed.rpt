Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch system_i/gamma_correction_0/inst/state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin system_i/gamma_correction_0/inst/state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch system_i/gamma_correction_0/inst/state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin system_i/gamma_correction_0/inst/state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch system_i/gamma_correction_0/inst/state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin system_i/gamma_correction_0/inst/state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock  
The generated clock system_i/rgb2dvi_0/U0/SerialClk has a sub-optimal master source pin selection, timing can be pessimistic
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '23' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
